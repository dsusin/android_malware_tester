android_malware_tester
======================

Install list of apk files and restore backup after each test.

Initial objective is for capturing malware-generated traffic.

Tested on SGS3, screen events would require adjustments for other terminals most likely.

Currently screen event is to automatically press the OpenVPN button at launch. If you don't need
it no further modifications here...

Requires TWRP on the terminal.

Requires a backup of the system on the sdcard (modify $remoteBackupOrigin).

evttrans.pl easies the event translation into perl commands, redirect event output to script.
